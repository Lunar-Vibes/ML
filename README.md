# Build a predictive analytics model for business insights using ML

- Optional: Code it using OOP.

## Data simulation and exploration

### Data simulation

- Create a simulated dataset representing a business scenerio. For example, simulate a dataset with features such as customer_id, age, income, purchase_history, and customer_satisfaction.
- Use numpy or pandas to generate this dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Perform EDA using pandas and visualizations (e.g., using Matplotlib or Seaborn) to understand the data distributions, correlations, and relationships between features.
- Identify potential features for modeling and any data preprocessing required (e.g., scaling, handling missing values).

### Data manipulation with SQL

- Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store the simulated data. Consider using NoSQL databases.
- Use SQL queries to aggregate or filter the data, such as finding average customer satisfaction by age group or income bracket.

## Model development and evaluation

### Model selection and implementation

- Linear Regression for predicting customer satisfaction based on features.
- Decision Trees for classification based on customer segments.
- Gradient Boosting for improved predictions.
- Neural Networks as an alternative approach.
- Use libraries like Scikit-learn and Keras to implement these models.

### Model training

- Split the dataset into training, validation and testing sets.
- Train the selected models on the training set and evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or other for regression and accuracy for classification.
- Cross-Validation - implement K-Fold cross-validation to assess model stability and performance better
- Feature engineering - create new features based on existing ones (e.g., a new feature represnting interaction between age and income).


### Model evaluation and comparison

- Compare the performance of your models based on evaluation metrics and think about the trade-offs of each model.
- Use hyperparameter tuning techniques (e.g., Grid Search) to optimize model performance. You can try out KerasTuner or look for other libraries.
- Sue ensemble methods such as Voting Classifier for classification tasks or Stacking to combine predictions from multiple models.

## Advanced data visualization and model deployment

- Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret model predictions, it should help you understand feature importance and model decisions.
- Try to save and load models using joblib or pickle, simulating model deployment.
- Save your best-performing model and provide a simple interface to make predictions on new simulated customer data.
